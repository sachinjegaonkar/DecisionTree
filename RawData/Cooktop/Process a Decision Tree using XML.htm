<p>A decision tree, as the name suggests, is a metaphorical tree which captures the various branches of options one could pursue</p>
<p>Often in our lives, we are caught at a cross-roads trying to decide
which of several options we could pursue. We pause and consider what we
can get involved in at that uncertainity point. We could branch into
any one of several options. Once we pursue any of those options; we
would then come to another node in the decision tree where we are again
caught trying to decide which course of action to follow</p>
<p>Once we reach a branch where we have no further options to explore;
then we need to check the various outcome of having reached that point
in our life</p>
<p>Analysing a decision tree is extremely simple. Its nothing much more
than a cost-benefit analysis; considering the probabilities of various
outcomes that one could reach. Read <a href="http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTED_04.htm" title="Opens in a new window" target="_blank">this article at Mindtools.com</a> for a thorough discussion and explanation of how the mathematics works</p>
<p>A decision tree can be easily captured as an XML file. I'll post the
DTD for it later on here when I get the time; but here is the English
explanation:</p>
<p>This XML file consists essentially of two types of elements: one is
&lt;decision&gt; &lt;/decision&gt; and the other is a singular element
&lt;outcome&gt; A <i>decision</i> element can contain one or more <i>decision</i> elements or it can contain one or more <i>outcome</i> elements. If it contains the latter, then it cannot contain any <i>decision</i> elements. Moreover, such a decision element must contain an attribute called <i>cost</i>. </p>
<p>The <i>outcome</i> element contains attributes called <i>probability</i> and <i>returns</i>. These terms are self explanatory once you read the Mindtools article</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="http://www.sabufrancis.com/decisiontree.zip">zip file</a>
containing the XML file containing the sample data which was used in
the mindtools article. I've written a XSL file which can process such
an XML file to do the decision tree analysis. That XSL file is also
placed in the zip file.</p>
<p>You can easily modify the XML file to suit your own needs. Also, the
XSL file can also be modified to bring in more sophistication in the
analysis and reporting (e.g. HTML output)</p>
<p><b>How to use the zip file?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Extract the zip file to a folder</li>
<li>Download a suitable XSLT processor (MSXSL can be downloaded from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnxml/html/msxsl.asp" title="Opens in a new window" target="_blank">the MSDN site</a>  There are other XSLT processors too)</li>
<li>Open a console window on your computer (Run "cmd" in Windows 2000 or XP)</li>
<li>Change directory to the folder where you've extracted the two files from the ZIP file</li>
<li>Run the XSLT processor so that the XSL does its magic on the XML file</li>
</ul>
<p>... or a simpler method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download cooktop from <a href="http://www.xmlcooktop.com/" title="Opens in a new window" target="_blank">http://www.xmlcooktop.com</a> and install it</li>
<li>Load the XML file and XSL file into cooktop</li>
<li>Press F5</li>
<li>Enjoy looking at the results</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use the cooktop method, and if you can be bold enough to
modify the XML file to suit your own decision trees, then you can
easily use it as an environment to analyse your own decisions.</p>
<p>Note: There are several downside to a decision making tool such as a
Decision tree. The most glaring of them is that the accuracy of the
decision tree depends on predicting the returns on outcomes and the
value of the probability of reaching those outcomes. So don't trust the
tool blindly. Spend quite some time thinking about the values you want
to enter</p>
<p>Happy decision making!</p>
